# Multiply a, b

# input: 2 numbers, a b, 2 integers

# output: 1 number, multiplication of a and b, 1 integers

# get an integer and save it as a variable a

# get an integer and save it as a variable b

# multiply both a and b

# print the multiplication of a and b

# def multiply(a b)
#   a * b
# end

# Solution
def multiply(a, b)
  a * b
num1 = "a" # first variable
num2 = "b" # second variable
output = num1*num2 # multiplied number

# print multiplied number
print(output)

def multiply(a, b)
  # save input from user into a variable called num 1
  # save input from user into a variable called num 2
  # multiply num1 * num2
  # output the result of num1 * num2
  num1 = a
  num2 = b
  puts a * b
end
